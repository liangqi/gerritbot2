immediate future
----------------

- route gerrit messages to a configurable set of channels, based on the project
  (always the default one though)
- color project names/branch names (see python bot for reference), should be
  configurable

further off
-----------

- get gerrit subject from change-id (I<hash>). might be difficult before Qt's
  gerrit upgrades and we get a REST API.
- some kind of IRC interface for configuring projects channels (to avoid restarting)

long term
---------

- store reviewer/contributor statistics in a bunch of interesting ways
- offer a web UI to view all this
